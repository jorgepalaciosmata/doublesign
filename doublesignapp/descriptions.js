    rat: {
      aries: `Congratulations -- you are one of the most energetic and successful combinations in the entire DoubleSign zodiac! The vim of your fiery Ram half combined with the personality, charisma, and business acumen of your inner Rat make the Rat/Aries a vibrant self-starter who overcomes all obstacles and is determined to be the best. Somewhat strait-laced, you can be a bit freewheeling in matters of the heart, but somewhat hypocritically can demand absolute fealty from a prospective life mate. In the office, your dual penchant for speed and accuracy make you an excellent multitasker. Beware the ultimate power position, however -- the loneliness at the top may prove to be too much for the gregarious "people person" hidden underneath that on-the-go exterior. Better to moderate your quest for achievement rather than to be left out in the cold by too much success!`,
      taurus: `The key word with you is loyalty. No one will ever be able to pull the wool over your eyes -- you'll see through them like cellophane every time. Combining as you do the unflappable calm and rock-solid strength of the Bull with the Rat's nervous intellect, you are a living testament to the efficacy of strategy, in love as in business. You carry yourself in a way that may seem a bit stuffy at first, but if you allow a select few to penetrate beyond your outer shell of acquaintances and into your inner circle of intimates, a playful side will make its slow appearance. A strong sense of duty coupled with the knowledge of when to say "thank you" makes the Rat/Taurus an excellent coworker to have at the desk in the next cubicle. Watch out for inertia!`,
      gemini: `Others had better keep an eye on you for your Rat-induced tendency to become that which they fear most -- a terminally self-obsessed egomaniac! A social hummingbird with zest to spare, you're an erratic lothario (courtesy of your Gemini heritage) who is only in it for the cheap thrills. Long-term relationships are anathema to you -- Rat/Geminis suffer from an extremely abbreviated attention span. Generous to a fault as far as your friends are concerned, you also tend to spread the wealth by treating your social calendar as a vast game of "musical chairs," with different participants every week. Same thing with "the blame game" -- it's always everyone else's fault when something goes wrong. (This can make you especially unpopular in a job setting if allowed to go unchecked.) Fun when kept firmly in hand, you require a steady partner that can put up with your kaleidoscopic antics without getting too frustrated or losing faith altogether.`,
      cancer: `The product of two intensely cerebral signs, a Rat/Cancer's personality is a private one. Nothing is more attractive for you than to curl up in a safe haven and navel-gaze for prolonged periods. Intellectual and emotional, you are a superb creator and make an ideal storyteller, whether professional or otherwise, thanks to your Cancer inheritance. In love you can be a mixed blessing.  There may be no other rival, but your habit of deep introspection may prove to be equally as intrusive and twice as trying -- after all, how can one name sheer ego as a co-respondent? And yet you exude a Rat's warmth, kindness and understanding, so much so in fact that one hesitates to let you go. One interesting side note concerns your concomitant fondness for fairness, equality and justice, both in the law courts and in the bedrooms. If they don't play it fair and square with you, they might as well pick up their ball and go home!`,
      leo: `Every morning you look into the mirror and ask two simple questions: "Am I perfect yet? And why not?" Everything the Rat/Leo does is geared around your unwavering commitment to perfection. In the business arena this fixation is manifested in a strongly motivated drive towards material success, courtesy of your Rat inheritance. Nothing but the best for family and friends, and certainly no dallying about with pointless dead-end subordinate positions! Top-gunner that you are due to the Lion in you, you unfortunately tend to impose your personal ambitions upon all in your orbit, and woe betide the friend or lover who fails to keep up, or falls beneath a storm of withering criticism! If one can stay the pace, you can prove to be one of the most dedicated partners in existence. Your promise of a continued presence can sometimes, however, turn out to be a thinly veiled threat.`,
      virgo: `Both the blessing and the bane of members of this introverted DoubleSign is the capacity for complete disregard of all forms of outside impetus. Rat/Virgos have a private clock that tells you your own sweet time in which to do things, and you stick to it, regardless of the demanding voice, the wheedling phone call, or the looming deadline. Such independence can naturally lead to an unhealthy isolation in matters of the heart, and you should remember to make an effort now and then to ditch your Virgo half, have a night on the town and rub some elbows with the fast crowd once in a while. Your memory, courtesy of the Rat in you, is as sharply defined as your capacity for ignoring well-intentioned advice, and it is important to remember that whatever road you may travel, you must travel it in voluntary solitude for most (if not all) of the journey. Friends are of utmost importance, as is the ongoing effort to prevent them from taking advantage of you.`,
      libra: `Given a healthy dollop of genius by both its Oriental and Occidental pedigrees, the Rat/Libra is one of the brightest, wittiest, and most scintillating personalities around. You are always broadcasting, which, if your friends and acquaintances can stand up to the constant barrage of me-isms, may often prove to be rewarding in both an emotional and a financial sense, as with great ego comes great generosity. Ever hopeful, ever fearful, ever conspiring and construing and gossiping, your love life as one of these endearingly convoluted devils is an engaging whirlwind in which no truths are held sacred save that of the idea of Love itself (capital L, please -- you take Love seriously because of your Libra side, as opposed to taking their partners seriously instead). A childlike charisma bathes such sensuous charmers as yourself in an aura of good feelings that will take you far in any walk of life, which is par for the course for the Rat in you. The trick is for you not to let the slings and arrows bruise your extra-sensitive skin.`,
      scorpio: `Manipulation, anyone? The Scorpio side of you is always out for number one, and the amazing quality of your self-aggrandizing tactics is that you so often get away with it by means of your Rat-induced radiant personal magnetism. Direct and forthright, you manage to defuse animosity by making no secret of what's in the deal and for whom. Others can respect such a straight-talking competitor; even if the Rat/Scorpio's concomitant razor-sharp wit and acid tongue can sometimes keep potential allies at bay unless kept in careful check. Suspicions, too, run rampant, and you had better learn to trust your significant other before serious stress-related health problems develop. Failure, too, must be looked at in its proper perspective, and cannot be allowed to bog you down, hard-driving pragmatist that you are, in a morass of self-loathing. Moral of the story: judge not lest ye be judged!`,
      sagittarius: `Always traveling and never getting to the destination -- this sums up the adventuresome and picaresque Rat/Sagittarius. With much of the candid nature of your occidental Sagittarius sign heritage, you are very much the cards-on-the-table sort of interpersonal negotiators. Too many hidden agendas can cause you to take a powder, and this is as true of your career as it is of your relationships. You adore luxury, but have a very low tolerance for pretentious snobs. Watch out for the itchy feet syndrome -- too much domesticity and you may be tempted to make a break for it, and damn the results. Wariness will accompany all of your permanent attachments, thanks to the Rat in you, and as a result you will probably marry late in life, if indeed you bother to make it to the altar at all.`,
      capricorn: `Power for its own sake, and the cold brutal solitary serenity that accompanies such an exalted position, are precisely what the Rat/Capricorn lives for. If they think they've seen goals-oriented people in action before, they haven't seen anything until they've seen the Rat in you breeze past them on your way to the top, in such a way as to make Genghis Khan seem mild-mannered, of whatever hierarchy to which you see fit to belong. This competitive streak can jeopardize the flip side of your success, which is the desire to be loved for your bad Capricorn self alone, and not because of position or possessions. Somewhere along the line the constant conflict between these two sides will have to be ironed out for you to be able to face life as an emotionally complete individual. Dangers to emotional equilibrium include tossing "inessentials" such as personal integrity, physical health, and even loved ones overboard for the sake of the next naked power grab. Beware the Ides of March!`,
      aquarius: `The spacey spiritual sensibilities of the Aquarius are here married to the material nature of the Rat to create a very self-conflicting sign. Neurosis can frequently rear its ugly head within the head of the Rat/Aquarius. Confusion and boredom with the workaday world are constant concomitants, as your precious fallacies and ideal expectations are shattered one by one. Given that, as one of these tentative, hypersensitive fence sitters, you are almost congenitally incapable of communicating your true emotions, your best bet is to settle down with the sort of staid, dependable, supportive person who usually drives you crazy with their pragmatism. This is the sort of dilemma that the inherent creative genius that inhabits members of this sign may take half a lifetime to solve to your interior satisfaction. Prediction: contradiction.`,
      pisces: `The Rat/Pisces is half of the whole picture. As a member of this sign, you prefer to function as one of a two-person team. In the best case scenario the other person is the permanent love interest (marriage is very much in favor with you nesting homebodies). In every other case the second person will be found outside of the love relationship -- perhaps taking the identity of a co-worker, mentor, or friend. Whether conflicts arise between the outside partnership and the inside partnership depend heavily upon your Piscean ability to use your superior powers of perception to defuse situations before they start. Often jealous -- a nod of thanks to your Rat heritage, here -- of the success of other, more venturesome personalities, you're an apparently incurable curmudgeon who hides a soft sweet side that only those closest to you are permitted to share.`
    },
    ox: {
      aries: `Pretension crumbles before the pragmatic presence of the Ox/Aries -- you are the epitome of the stable achiever. Wide-eyed and ambitious in your go-getting youth like a good Aries, you can slug it out toe-to-toe with the world for years before it fails to meet up with the abnormally high expectations that are part and parcel of this your sign. Then it's time for the grand disillusionment and retreat into sanctuary -- usually typified by a homey nest. Romantic you are not, thanks to your Ox background. Watch out for a tendency to give practical gifts come Christmastime, like new underwear (not lingerie) -- they won't be fully appreciated. Down-home coziness turns you on, so, if someone else wants to start up a love affair with your hardworking country style self, they'd better practice their hewing-of-wood and drawing-of-water skills. A simple gingham frock is highly recommended -- either that or a pair of bib overalls.`,
      taurus: `Offspring of the Ox and Bull, you are a very concentrated individual. Patient, big, undeniably slow, you endure through the ages like granite. You don't talk much about what you do, but what you do, you do meticulously, and correctly the first time. So what if you took the time it would take for someone else to do fifteen other things in a slipshod manner? "Quality takes time" is the undying motto of the Ox/Taurus. It's all about quality over quantity here. Your sternness can be off-putting to the casual lover, but if played and won correctly, you can be the most steadfast and enduring mate around. Only they'd better watch out! If you're pushed too far, the gentle beast within you can erupt in cruel and spiteful anger, and charge the red flag of your discord with both horns bared.`,
      gemini: `The most stable of the flighty Gemini brood, the Ox/Gemini breed are notorious for your split personality approach to your inevitable romantic antics. On the one hand, your Ox component wishes to establish a nice, comfy home arrangement, complete with loving partner. On the other hand, your Gemini component needs a separate expressly sexual lover on the side. Be sure you know which side of the dividing line your partners line up on. And should you be unfortunate enough to end up being exposed as a two-timer, it's important to cultivate something of a forgive-and-forget attitude from your new enemies (as well as conceal any of your other extracurricular activities), since you are in the habit of neither forgiving nor forgetting a perceived breach of loyalty -- and any complaint will be perceived as such! Such an unfair double standard is typical of you, but that's the way it has to be -- everything just the way you like it, all the time, regardless of propriety or even possibility.`,
      cancer: `A charmed sign, as an inhabitant of the Ox/Cancer combination you are emotion in motion personified. You are purposeful (although your detractors might say "stubborn") as the Ox, and supersensitive (although your detractors might say "hypersensitive") as the Crab -- you know how to achieve that which you feel to be right, without wasting too much time and effort thinking about the results of your manic drive or questioning the worth of your goals. Everything else comes second, including the relationship. If they're not there to boost your ego or buffer you against the impact of the crowd, then they are of no use to you and must be discarded. A definitely cold customers, you have a nasty habit of taking your lovers for granted and keeping them in isolation while you set out to conquer the known world.`,
      leo: `Humility? Your fire-drenched Leo heart has never heard of the word. It would be an affront to your dignity, and every mistake, no matter how small, has got to be covered up and made to disappear. A profound personal silence, intended to insure the Ox/Leo's sense of personal gravity, may make you, orderly neat-freak that you are, appear harshly indifferent to the sublime blandishments of L-O-V-E. But you're not. You just hide it better than most. The trick is for you to loosen up a bit, both in and out of bed. The lover that manages to instill a sense of playfulness in you will be the lover to reward with a lifetime of devotion and radiant smiles. Easier said than done for such a one, however -- you are a grim soul who has a hard time mustering up the necessary facility of expression with which to convey your strong emotional outpourings. You need the catalyst of outside affection to jump-start your own sentimental engine. The Ox half of you needs to watch out for a tendency towards excessive micromanagement!`,
      virgo: `Conservatism runs deep in the Ox/Virgo's veins, as your Ox heritage concomitantly makes you a drudging workhorse. Reliable and efficient as only a Virgo can be, you are living proof that a person can still toil their way to the top. The problem is that for you the toiling part can take twenty years of slow, patient arrangement, which may not bother you in the slightest but will drive everyone else around you batty with anticipation.  Your inside is as meticulously arranged as your outside. They should never argue with you about such great intangibles as aesthetics or morality -- you'll take great personal offense if they even so much as hint that they don't agree with the elaborate personal world system you've concocted. Nothing will impress you except someone who truly shares your willingness to work as hard as possible, for as long as possible -- you won't settle for anything less. Your best quality when it comes to your romantic strategy is that you are quite often very well funded. Industrious people never lack for money.`,
      libra: `The Ox/Libra is a seething storm of inner turmoil wrapped in a protective shell. You are utterly fascinated by the idea of perfect purity and order as per your Libra perspective, and constantly strive for it in all aspects of your life. Yet your internal contradictions keep tripping you up unconsciously: the wrong job, the wrong place to live, and the wrong relationship. But that Ox perseverance keeps sending you right back for more, in the naive hope that perhaps everything will go as planned the next time around. But it never does, and the intelligent Libra side of your equation knows that it never will go smoothly -- thus the constant conflict. On the plus side, you have a way with words, and will gleefully broadcast a play-by-play of your personal emotional wars to everyone within earshot, charming them with animated descriptions of amusing situations. After all, who would have thought that such a self-proclaimed perfectionist could have gotten involved with all of those out-and-out lunatics?`,
      scorpio: `If you're one of these glittering sociopaths, you sweep across the land with a sound like thunder. Always right, always on top and always working for the next big triumph, the Ox/Scorpio may seem like a bit of a shallow social climber. And let's not be fooled -- this is in fact the case. As an inheritor of the Scorpio syndrome, you live for personal gain and the exercise of power, while your Ox-based work ethic may perhaps explain why you're so good at acquiring and wielding it. You are disinterested in competition from any source, which is why you prefer to choose your mates primarily for their good looks and not for their intellectual conversation. It helps, for others romantically involved with you, to be at least as crazy as you are, or at least pretend to be so. Otherwise you're liable to get bored with the whole arrangement and kick them unceremoniously to the curb in favor of a more razzle-dazzle drama queen.`,
      sagittarius: `Living your life in public, as one of the people born under this combination of signs you always seek to have an audience. This makes the Ox/Sagittarius a born coupler; in fact, you are the sort of person who is always in a relationship -- sometimes neglecting to end the old one before the new one begins. But it all comes out all right in the end. After all, your Sagittarian consideration never meant for you to hurt anybody, least of all yourself. For the most part, your life is well worth watching as you act out your public dramas. With such a fiery personality, you excel at risk-taking and even courting danger to the point of grievous bodily harm (a quality of Ox-inspired insensitivity to pain). In the process you may also manage to overwhelm your mates with a steady stream of sincere flattery that goes straight to their heads. They should beware your emotional smoke screen, however -- it could be a guilty conscience that motivates you to sing like a canary, especially with all those witnesses standing around and staring.`,
      capricorn: `The Ox/Capricorn is the sort of person who will dissect the goose in order to find out why it keeps giving you the golden eggs. The Ox in you will never give up on a project; instead, you attempt to take it to its ultimate conclusion, with the result that you quite often manage to pervert its initial mission statement and indeed to mangle the results. Coupled with this amazing faculty for "stick-to-itiveness" is your incongruous gourmet's palate. Not that this connotes an interest in healthy food -- just really classy junk food. No prepackaged snack cakes for your dining pleasure, but make it a double portion of baked Alaska, and pronto! Folks born under this sign are also repositories of received knowledge, and it doesn't do any good for anyone to argue with you -- even though you can be wrong about things with disturbing frequency, as a true scion of the house of Capricorn you'll never admit it.`,
      aquarius: `Moody and sulky, how could anyone tolerate the Ox/Aquarius, a withdrawn child in adult clothing? Because of your truly enormous and gifted propensity for storytelling, that's why, as inherited from your Aquarius side. You've got it refined down to an art form, and your ballistic sense of humor will have every anecdote lavishly peppered with witticisms, enough to keep the whole crowd in gut-wrenching hilarity -- that is, when you choose to deploy it, which isn't often, as the Ox in you is taciturn. You often indulge in orgies of self-sacrifice for the sake of a little bit of fun, and will be more than happy to help drag everybody else in the immediate neighborhood straight to "the place to be" along with you. Bipolar in your attitudes towards work and play, home and mate, it's best not to take yourself too seriously. After all, no matter how sincere you may be right now, you're a lovable rogue with a fickle mind that could change tomorrow, with disastrous consequences for anyone who might have depended upon you for security and support.`,
      pisces: `Calm and decorum reign in the respectable life of the Ox/Pisces. You will have a taste for material goods, and on a grand scale. A perennial homebody thanks to the input of the Fishes, you have a tendency to over-decorate your elaborate nest -- all in the interest of good taste, of course. You counterbalance your urge to be larger than life with a quiet ambition and productive Ox-inspired work ethic. You would prefer to mate for life, preferably with one who will both inspire and return a mutual shared respect. Solitude is avoided by you, as befits a natural clan leader, but so are overlarge crowds. Thoroughly private in both outlook and effectiveness, you have a way of getting things done that involves not doing anything and letting the game play out to its foregone conclusion. Due to your uncanny interpersonal radar, you're so calculating a game-player (and game-winner) that you can often predict an outcome ahead of time, to the bafflement of your opponents.`,
    },
    tiger: {
      aries: `Banzai! There's nothing in the world that can hinder you from taking what is rightfully yours, not with the habitual Aries blaze burning within you to fuel your rampaging career. Trust your luck -- you've got it in job lots and are under no compulsion to keep it in reserve. The temptation to command will be overwhelming at times for the Tiger/Aries, but if you want a little tender loving care, be sure to remember the others are human, too. Don't believe everything you hear, either -- it's just like the Tiger in you to go barreling in where angels fear to tread, based upon the slimmest and most unreliable intelligence. You are at the mercy of what you want to hear. Beware most of all the deceptive flattery of the false alliance!`,
      taurus: `Take it easy there, trooper! "No sense going off half-cocked" is the key phrase of the Tiger/Taurus. You use your spare time wisely to think your way through the maze ahead of time, and then bask comfortably in others' amazement when everything unfolds smooth as cream. Your taste for sheer, unadulterated Work with a capital "W" will bring you out ahead of the herd of other Bulls in the long run, and you are incapable of being discouraged when involved in something your Tiger heart believes in. Others will take this dedication to mean disinterest in matters of the heart, but if they too are patient they may strike your planet's seething molten core in time. You have a nasty habit of taking for granted that which is not at all steady and harboring grave suspicions of that which is firmer than the Rock of Gibraltar. Be sure not to skip your personal planning sessions -- "measure twice, cut once," as the old saw has it.`,
      gemini: `You're really something, you know that? Of course you do, being a Gemini born in a Tiger year. You're irresistible to any prospective mate, with your hefty one-two punch of charisma and intellect -- enough for two people. This stands the Tiger/Gemini in good stead throughout your swinger's career of taking hearts and breaking them in succession, as you get bored. But once this emotional scalp hunt of yours dies down, the Gemini in you is going to seek permanence, and that's when you'll find your own personal Tiger tamer, complete with whip and chair. You never enjoy what's really for your own good, but that's probably due to your tendency to mistake the bad for the good and the good for the bad. You aren't the most perceptive person on earth, but this doesn't bother you, for you are full well convinced that you've got enough sizzle to disguise, at rock bottom, your fundamental lack of steak.`,
      cancer: `The calm lake seldom betrays its roiled depths. The Tiger/Cancer type is a person of vast unrest. Your seething torment is completely internalized, however, as befits your Crab half. The ego-tripping of the Tiger can, in a Cancerous environment of isolation and self-obsessed withdrawal, be brought to almost pathological levels if not tempered now and then with a dose of reality. This is why you have that material side that you're always indulging -- and why you should continue to pamper yourself every now and then with some of the finer things in life. These luxuries are your necessities. You need them to get you out of yourself once in a while. If your mate can't understand this, too bad for them, but don't let their quest for an explanation of the causes of your wild mood swings cast you into the depths of an abiding sulk. You're better than that, and besides, your internal chaos can produce sublime beauty in the arts if allowed the proper concentration and discipline.`,
      leo: `The very fact that the Tiger/Leo would vote itself Monarch of the World in a second is indicative of the problems in your life, the primary problem of which is that you're just too damn wonderful for your own good. This has a tendency to leave you miserable in your royal Leo's isolation, as others often feel they aren't good enough to share the same air you breathe. If you really want to make friends and influence people, you're going to have to learn how to assume an air of convincing false modesty -- nothing's hereditary any more, least of all the loyalty of the servants. Speaking of which, try to avoid your impolite habit of bragging about your conquests of your exuberant Tiger's heart. You may think such boasts establish you as cock of the walk, but in reality it won't be long until everyone is asking, "Who killed Cock Robin?"`,
      virgo: `Oh, you'll perform, all right. The Tiger/Virgo is always the best at what they do, and you better be, considering what they pay you to do it. But they can't make you like it, and you let everybody know this, around the clock. Beware of driving away loved (and loving) ones with a steady stream of moans and complaints. Your negative attitude towards life's bounty is half feigned (Tiger), half sincere (Virgo), but every now and then the sincere side dominates and you are just plain bad company. Your additional Virgo tendency towards anal retentiveness seems perfectly natural to you, but you seem unable to explain the basic pluses of neatness and order to the lackadaisical bums with whom you share an office or an apartment. It would do you good to come down off of your mountain once in a while to rub elbows with us normal people -- it might garner you more support in the grand organization.`,
      libra: `The Tiger/Libra is slavishly devoted to the ideal love -- so much so, in fact, that you have a hard time coping with all of the real love out there, stemming as it does from real people who can often get on your nerves when they won't adhere to your entirely arbitrary sense of aesthetic order. Having the milk of the Tiger to sustain you, however, you are more prone than the average Libra to attempting to force others to fit your patterns, with the result that you are invited to slightly fewer parties than the average Libra. But don't despair -- your radiant personal magnetism will attract plenty of willing converts for you to toy with and throw away. Part of you will always remain the eternal child, which accounts for the preservation of your youthful good looks long past the point where your excessive vices should have had you looking like the picture of Dorian Grey in its last stages.`,
      scorpio: `The Tiger/Scorpio is one of those hopelessly active and accomplished signs that is always striving for more and greater kingdoms to conquer, preferably by application of overwhelming force in heavy doses. After all, what good is conquest if you can't abuse the conquered populace? But watch out -- the Scorpion in you has a tendency to apply these brutal scorched earth tactics to your own heart and your own mind. You are aptly named, as the Scorpion is an arthropod that can sting itself to death in its choked fury, and the Tiger is proverbial for his overweening pride. You had better run not walk to the nearest dictionary and read the entry for "hubris" before you go any further, unless the spectacle of your own grand impending self-wrought doom hanging over you exerts a sort of weird fascination upon you, which may very well be the case. Cultivate forgiveness, as difficult as that may sound under such circumstances.`,
      sagittarius: `Before you get discouraged, keep in mind that against boredom even the gods content in vain. When the Tiger /Sagittarius is alone at home you wish you were at the party, and when you make it to the party and find yourself surrounded by the same old, same old good times you wish you were at home alone again, where it is possible for you to brood comfortably. Home is something of a malleable concept for you -- your Sagittarian abode is the wide world itself, and you are always opening doors to new rooms within it. Some dare call it a Tiger's inconstancy -- you prefer the term "intrepid." You "boldly go where no one has gone before," and only in retrospect bother to wonder why no one has made a television show about your life and loves. Don't ask your loves, though -- they'll tell you why not, and in unsparing detail.`,
      capricorn: `You have your own pace, and it's an amazingly fast one. Events and people pass by you to vanish in the slipstream, as you dash oblivious from one good deed to another. A Tiger/Capricorn just can't help it -- you're a philanthropist born and bred, although your Tiger half's disdain for authority and all forms of hierarchy makes your philanthropy more the "giving-money-to-the-bum-on-the-corner" kind rather than the "donating-a-million-dollars-to-build-an-orphanage" kind of kindness. As a Capricorn you're not that skilled with the handling of business matters, but this is counterbalanced by an array of friends that love you to distraction. In fact, the biggest task of your romantic life will be separating your most significant other from your cloud of well-wishers to a degree that meets with his or her approval. Don't inflate the currency of your love by spending it too freely.`,
      aquarius: `The cerebral nature of the airy Aquarius part of you is galvanized into constant motion by your Tiger aspect, with contradictory results. In other words, you're a constantly bustling ball of energy that never seems to get anything done. You enjoy creating work for yourself that eats up time and is fundamentally unproductive -- it's your form of recreation. Pets and children can aid the Tiger/Aquarius in this fruitless process -- their demands make you feel needed and loved in a way that their love alone would not. After all, you're not hurting anyone else by this propensity for unrequited labor. But don't expect a sympathetic ear from those who have watched you from afar -- they'll simply tell you to cut down on the extracurricular activities and spend more time in the bathtub. You need a lover who can teach you how to relax, and somehow put up with your dynamo instincts in the process.`,
      pisces: `You learn by doing, and doing it wrong the first time. The sensitive soul of the Tiger/Pisces may fall in love at the drop of a glove at first, but after the first dozen or so sophomore crushes, you'll be a bit charier about whom you give your heart to for Christmas. At least one can't deride you for lacking a Tiger's tenacity in these matters, but that's cold comfort each time romance slips through your fingers. Pain may metamorphose into rage with stasis -- as with all Piscean sharks, it is important to keep looking and never look back, lest you spend too much time in an impossibly rosy past. Don't take it out on strangers, either. Learn to control and focus your energy inward and you may at last achieve the spiritual rewards for which you have been yearning, consciously or unconsciously, your whole life through. Stop asking "Am I there yet?" You'll know it when you get there. In this you have a distinct edge over the other members of the DoubleSign menagerie.`,
    },
    rabbit: {
      aries: `The Rabbit/Aries is possessed of an insatiable lust for knowledge of all kinds. An avid Aries-inspired altruist at heart, you wish to lavish the benefits of your hard-earned trivia upon all and sundry, but don't be surprised if many refuse to sit still for the lecture. Emotionally you prefer a cushion, which corresponds perfectly with the padded Rabbit aspect of the rest of your lifestyle. Watch out for extended periods of withdrawal -- the rubber room beckons, being the ultimate surrogate womb for which you have been searching since you were evicted from the real womb. In the mean time, just hang around the house -- you're the consummate homemaker and decorator, although your quirky sense of interior rhythms has baffled more than one lover who has shared your space.`,
      taurus: `The down side of the Rabbit/Taurus is that you're materialistic, or, in plainer terms, greedy -- as only the Ox can be. The up side is that you know exactly what to do with the money once you've got it in your hot little paws. Living a life surrounded by the finest in creature comforts and the most refined of entertainments, the Rabbit touch makes you the ultimate arbiter of taste in your circle. You cannot abide the crass and the vulgar -- which shuts you out of much of today's societal milieu, not to mention limits your employment choices. You are convinced that you were born too late and that life was better in the past. You seek a mate of similarly refined tastes and habits, but can be easily discouraged by the prolonged search. Your weakness is a marked tendency to err on the side of self-regard.`,
      gemini: `The Rabbit/Gemini is, for lack of a better word, jumpy, and no one can predict which way you'll jump next. Too much is not enough for you -- the Gemini within you is constantly bored and crave round-the-clock stimulation from those you see as your entertainers, up to and including your significant other. Once the show that is never supposed to end finally ends, as it must, you're out the door faster than one can shout "abracadabra!" in search of the next big thrill. You really need someone who can calm you down long enough to make use of your considerable Rabbit-sponsored powers of inventiveness, but it's difficult for you to consciously accept the role of underling. An astute balance of responsibilities works best in conjunction with your fervent creative side: let someone else shovel the coal while you drive the train.`,
      cancer: `The key phrase for the Rabbit/Cancer is "family style." Since both Cancer and the Rabbit have strong nesting instincts, is it any wonder that you are the happy homemaker par excellence? You maintain close connections with your parents throughout your adult life, and work best in a large extended family setting. Children, when they arrive on the scene, are the jewels in your crown -- their safety and security are your paramount goals. You have a great sense of place, and never stray far from the ancestral hearth. If much of this makes you an anachronism in today's scattered world, so be it. Everyone else is missing out on the simple joys of life that you and your solid life mate find so reassuring.`,
      leo: `Tempering the shyness of the Rabbit with the fire of the Lion, you have a style and assertiveness not available to the other bunnies, who tend, on the whole, to be "shrinking violets." The Rabbit/Leo's social sensibilities tend to cloak your leonine aggressiveness in a protective veneer of politesse, so that your enemies may not know that they're your enemies until it's too late for them to do anything about it. You are tailor-made for a career in the diplomatic corps, as you are the proverbial mailed fist concealed within a velvet glove. This caring exterior also helps in your love life by attracting sensitive individuals to your side, while the steel interior prevents you from being taken advantage of in overly dependent relationships. All in all, this is a most winning combination for the would-be social butterfly.`,
      virgo: `A nurturing neat freak with a Virgo passion for cleanliness, comfort, order, and obscurity, that's what the Rabbit/Virgo is all about. You have the same obsession with security as regards your job prospects, which is one of the many reasons that the health care professions are your ideal goal when it comes to career choices. You border on the paranoid when it comes to germs, and would boil your clothing daily if thought that by such action you could keep the grime of the world from your skin. Choose a partner who will make you feel good about your weight, too, as that's another of the details about you that is never resolved to your entire satisfaction. Your Rabbit's concern for your personal health may prove to be well founded if you don't get out from time to time and get some exercise.`,
      libra: `The Rabbit/Libra is a pampered, spoiled, surfeited brat -- and everyone else envies you for this. You are lazy and live well off the proceeds. Even-tempered and true to your Libran namesake, you seek a balance between all parties concerned. You are not a person of action, but a person of communication, and you absolutely cannot tolerate raw emotions, harsh dissonances, or indeed unpleasantness of any kind. You are in the habit of selecting the "flight" option from the "fight or flight" menu when the opportunity presents itself. "There is no problem so great that it can't be avoided," this is your personal motto, and your long string of ex-lovers can confirm that, since you hit the ground running as soon as the dew has dried from the bloom of the shared romance. You are the champion rascal of Rabbits, however, and you will never run out of willing victims for your charm.`,
      scorpio: `Beneath the calm, cool and collected exterior of the Rabbit/Scorpio lurks the soul of a confirmed character assassin. As a Scorpio you are proud and vengeful -- your ideal career may very well be psychotherapy. You are a terminal disciplinarian both with your loved ones and your servants, and indeed it can be difficult sometimes for all concerned to figure out where the line is between the two categories. You are obsessed with your appearance in the eyes of the world due to your Rabbit half, and any perceived slight on this front will be returned tenfold from your capacious reservoirs of interior venomous wit. It is because of these exterior considerations that you are often difficult to reach, and many a potential romance may founder on the rocks of your emotional isolationism!`,
      sagittarius: `As a Rabbit/Sagittarius, your supreme fluidity in social situations makes you a natural ambassador among the classes. Your Sagittarian manners always find their proper level given the tone of the company you keep, and you would be no more ostracized from a backwoods hootenanny than you would be from the toneyest boite in the biggest, baddest city. Compulsive traveler that you are, you will take a lover in every port, and think nothing of it until your romantic pluralism raises a hue and cry among those who believe that you've treated them unfairly, at which time you should take great pains to see that they do not band together against you in their efforts to bring you down. Should they do so despite your best efforts to keep them separated, do what you do best and run, Rabbit, run!`,
      capricorn: `The Rabbit/Capricorn is a hard worker, a good provider, and a faithful lover -- why can't everyone in the world be like you? You may be somewhat reticent (thanks to your Goat heritage), especially with expressing your affections, but those close to you can feel your support telepathically and thus always rely on its eminently reliable presence. Diligence is the key to your inevitable success in the turbulent business arena -- that is, if one politely overlooks the overwhelming hungers for money and possessions that provide the motivating factor. All those nights of burning the candle at both ends will pay off handsomely in the long run, as long as you make sure not to switch boats in midstream. Yours is a silent but unshakeable dignity inherited as part of your Rabbit patrimony, one rarely disturbed for even the closest of your few select confederates.`,
      aquarius: `Any Rabbit/Aquarius these days was born at the right time -- your passion for the odds-and-ends of our technophiliac age is barely sated by the constant stream of new gadgetry that comes off the assembly lines each week. This Aquarian zest for novelty in the guise of hardware dovetails nicely with your Rabbit-inspired couch potato tendencies, and will render you flabby unless you work at getting a bit of track time in on weekends. Your rosy outlook on life is also reflected in the renewed optimism of this our pristine century, and in fact you can be something of an insufferable Pollyanna to friends and neighbors both. But this will certainly not bother you -- after all, nothing else seems to bother you, ever. Negative emotions dispersed at night with a good private cry are nobody's business but your own.`,
      pisces: `The Rabbit/Pisces has the ability to handle large amounts of people with skill and ease, in series or en masse, but this you do not particularly enjoy, being at heart a solitary creature. Your Rabbit-triggered desire to bring life to your concepts and emotions will bleed over into your professional life if you do provide yourself with an artistic outlet, and in fact it would be better for you to merge the two interests as soon as possible. Your mental hygiene demands that you unburden yourself of all the psychic effluvium that collects at the bottom of your Piscean mind on a regular basis, and art is certainly cheaper than extended therapy. Your capacity for involuntary empathy can give you a near inexhaustible source of inspiration and background material, if you can turn your own introspection process off for a moment or two every day and simply listen to the teeming swirl of life that surrounds you.`,
    },
    dragon: {
      aries: `Don't hesitate to bet the bank on your luck; it's good for it and so are you. Being the leader of the pack comes naturally to you as the Dragon/Aries. After all, you reason to yourself, someone's got to be in charge of things -- that's the Dragon talking. Being born under the conjunction of two powerful signs gives you the ability to back your luck with good old-fashioned talent, whether in the boardroom or in bed. Watch out for the succubus of self-regard, though -- your overwhelming Aries passion for your own ego is bound to upset a few promising romantic interludes until you learn to rein it in. Given time you'll be able to crawl out from under your own shadow and truly care for someone, but right now it's time to prioritize.`,
      taurus: `The Dragon/Taurus isn't out to win any popularity contests, which is for the best since you are out to win just about everything else. The placid Bull is energized by the zest of the Dragon into putting his work ethic into full-steam-ahead mode. This means twice as much, twice as fast -- but watch you don't burn out the motor overnight! You play your heart's cards close to your vest, but inside you're a seething ocean of unrequited love. If you could ever manage to make satisfying personal contact with a like-minded individual you'd fall hook, line and sinker, but given your busy schedule, chances are you won't have the opportunity to find out what unadulterated passion tastes like, unless you pencil it into your personal planner ahead of time.`,
      gemini: `The Dragon/Gemini would be much better company if you weren't so completely aware of what good company you are. Eminently charismatic (thank your Dragon side for this gift) and a silver-tongued flatterer born and bred, you are irresistible to your many potential love interests -- not to mention polite enough to give equal time to all of them, simultaneously, as there is more than enough of your Gemini half to go around. Sadly, many of them don't see the situation in quite the same light as you do, obliging you to slip away in the dark from time to time. But all's fair in love, war, and a short attention span, right? Right. Besides, it's not as though you didn't have half a million other projects simmering on the back burner of your capacious stove, is it? Good thing "multitasking" is your middle name; otherwise it would take you even longer than it normally would to bring all of your plans to fruition.`,
      cancer: `Not only does the Dragon/Cancer possess the exquisite sensibility of the artist, your Dragon sign heritage gives you the work ethic to actually produce art on a regular basis! Quality stuff, too -- once your drive for success kicks in, you should tower head and shoulders over your more, let's face it, pedestrian contemporaries. A Crablike introspection is your strong point, as much of your innate vibrancy is directed exclusively towards the goal of finding out what makes you tick. You're about as meek and mild as a Dragon ever gets, though, so capitalize on that fact in affairs of the heart. Your sensitivity should go a long way towards establishing your sincerity to a prospective mate. Incidentally, "once and done" for you -- you mate for life, and must needs therefore pick either a like-minded mate, or else a good lawyer for that inevitable midlife crisis.`,
      leo: `Don't give in to your tendency to go too far! If the Dragon/Leo stretches its claw out to seize what you consider to be rightfully yours, you may very well draw back a bloody stump, unless you put in some reconnaissance effort first. You are the consummate Dragon king, but don't let everyone else know this in so many words, or you'll be a ruler without subjects. Be as protective to your loved ones as you like, but don't impress upon them the necessity to feel obligated. In fact, you might want to consider enrolling in a charm school, for while you are a person of indomitable willpower and unstoppable Lion might, your manners could use a bit of practice to finesse your inevitable takeover of the known world. No one likes a rude despot, after all.`,
      virgo: `Whimsical and freewheeling the Dragon/Virgo is not. A typical Virgo in your regimented preferences, you believe in a place for everything and everything in its place. Sadly, the Dragon in you is prone to categorize your fellow human beings as "things," even the ones you care for very strongly. Don't be afraid to let your sunnier side shine through, and maybe even let your hectic schedule and Swiss-watch organization slide for an hour or two. Disorder is necessarily present in the finest order -- the contrast is needed, for without disorder, how could you tell if your system were truly organized? You will draw much outside criticism for your successes, but ignore the whispers around the water cooler, as those who talk don't do, and those who do don't waste time talking about it.`,
      libra: `The Dragon/Libra has so much to give, and the style and wit of your acts of giving seem to mandate a career in show business. Not that you're all surface and no substance -- there's a moody, pensive Libran soul deep down inside, if both you and everybody else could get past that glittering Dragon shield you habitually hide behind. True to the sign of the Scales, your sense of fair play is hypertrophied enough to allow you to become a public defender, consumer advocate, or similar champion of the populace at large. This choice of career may not dovetail well with your all-consuming lust for luxurious living, however, as the people rarely reward their volunteer supporters with amounts commensurate with value given. This could sour you in later life if you don't take steps to reinforce your idealism every once in a while.`,
      scorpio: `The Dragon/Scorpio is a crazed, incalculable, gargantuan superstar in embryo. You'll go all-out towards that impossible goal, and get there in no time or know the reason why. You're the sort who loves nothing more than to find a brick wall and beat your head against it until it falls, as it always does for you in the end. As a Dragon heir apparent, control is everything for you -- if you lose it, you'll crash and burn, and you will not have that! Skirting the outer limits of self-destruction is merely a lifestyle choice for you, nothing more. You can often be at the mercy of your strong Scorpio sexual urges, but afterwards it's always back to the business at hand. You expect absolute fealty from your lovers, and can never trust them out of your sight, but it's pointless making them sign those notarized oaths of fealty you keep under the bed. All you can do is pull in the reins on your tendency towards terminal jealousy, before it wipes out another perfect relationship.`,
      sagittarius: `People flock to gather around a Dragon/Sagittarius, because you're a total hedonist and bring the party with you wherever you go. You manage to be a Dragon-style leader by simply managing to have more fun than anybody else, anytime, anywhere. You're so cheerful it's sometimes nauseating to anyone other than a fellow Sagittarius. You have a heart big as all outdoors, which makes you the ultimate romantic philanthropist -- but don't get carried away to the point of being embarrassed by your choice of lovers. Relationships based on pity never work in the long run, and by now you should know this. You find yourself gravitating, geographically speaking, to the California coast, as your penchant for outdoor activities like skydiving, rollerblading, surfing, mountain biking and snowboarding is most easily indulged in that locale. Be sure to stick to the prospective mate that shares this interest in all-out exercise!`,
      capricorn: `What's more important than romance in a Dragon/Capricorn's life? As it stands, just about everything. Your career especially -- the Dragon in you is so gung-ho for that big promotion and the next rung of the ladder to conquer that you can scarcely spare a moment for that hottie in the next cubicle who's been giving you the eye all afternoon. Fearless in every other aspect, you are squeamish when it comes to love, as you are uncomfortable sharing yourself with others on a personal level, thanks to your Capricorn heritage. You're afraid that others may find certain aspects of your personality unpalatable. Well, maybe they will and maybe they won't, but you'll never know until you try. Try not to worry -- no one's perfect, after all. There's more slack in the dating world than you might give it credit for. Don't let mass media get you down; you don't have to look like a model to get quality attention.`,
      aquarius: `A Dragon/Aquarius is the consummate neophiliac. You crave sensation, and you live for the spectacle of a dimly imagined future becoming a reality right in front of your nose. This is your era; you were definitely born at the right time. Your Aquarian sense of innovation is not limited to technology -- changes in social mores also appeal to you, and you pride yourself on being a card-carrying member of the avant-garde, any avant-garde at all. Highly cerebral, you are often at great pains to advance the boundaries of what you perceive to be a highly limited consciousness. A law unto your Dragon self, your independence may be compromised by a brush with outside lawmakers if your big bad brain doesn't succeed in scaring some caution into you once in a while, especially when in unfamiliar surroundings. Safety first!`,
      pisces: `Watch out for reality -- it has a tendency to bite you back, and hard, when you enter into it with exalted expectations. The Dragon/Pisces has a head that is in the clouds twenty-four seven, and you prefer it that way, if only you could figure out how to pay the bills in the meantime. Romance is everything for the Fish in you, but once the petals of emotion's blossom hit the ground, it's all over, since you have no use for a good, healthy, mutually supportive blah blah blah. You want love, not lust and not domesticity. If this makes you appear fickle to others, then so be it, for why shouldn't the Dragon in you have what it most desires? You have an uncanny knack for remaining friends with your ex-lovers, and indeed can amass quite a collection during the course of your lifetime. Try not to abuse the privilege, however, or the Fishes could find themselves in very hot water!`,
    },
    snake: {
      aries: `Never one for the noisy expenditure of the nightlife, a good book in an easy chair in front of a roaring fireplace with just the right compact disc playing in the background is more the Snake/Aries idea of a swell time after hours. Not that you're a stick in the mud, or a prudish sort -- you're just as much a hedonist as everyone else, and that's precisely why you prefer your own unique blend of entertainment. Romantically speaking, it's the Ram in you who will instantly drop their heart on the ground, and then, reaching to pick it back up again, accidentally kick it far away from you. Your biggest hurdle is your Snake sense of dignity. If you don't loosen up and learn to laugh at yourself once a while, it's going to be difficult to find anything else to laugh about instead -- or anyone else to laugh with.`,
      taurus: `Kick back, relax, and when the moment presents itself -- as it will do, sooner or later, if the Snake/Taurus will only cultivate the proper patience -- strike! You appear to be a languid Snaky pleasure junky, but deep inside you harbor a secret Ox-style agenda, and it's right on schedule. It's because your opponents don't recognize you as an opponent that you are able to overcome them with ease. You're knowledgeable enough in the rhythms and ways of the business world to know that problems can solve themselves if left alone, or at least treated with a minimum of intervention. This reclining attitude carries over into your love life, and many a partner will appear to tumble into your lap as if by magic. Only you will know that you have slyly laid the emotional groundwork months, sometimes years, in advance.`,
      gemini: `The Snake/Gemini is a real charmer -- just wait until someone succeeds in charming you! Lucky for the Snake in you that you're a bit on the self-indulgent and even lazy side, or else you might have the urge to use your powers for evil intentions. As it is, you could be best described as romantically careless in fine Gemini style -- you slide into and out of situation with an ease and grace that leaves those who should be annoyed at your oily tactics just that much more infatuated with you. Easily bored, you often turn to literature for solace, but nothing to deep for your tastes -- you'd rather pore over a book of pithy aphorisms to use in conversation at the many parties you attend, rather than some tedious tome of dialectical materialist economic theory. You also excel at any trivia-based game, as your stock of odd facts is nearly limitless.`,
      cancer: `Sure, the Snake/Cancer is a homebody -- but what a homebody! Your home isn't just a castle to you, it's a palace, and no matter what the circumstances, your innate love of luxury items and your magnificent sense of aesthetics will have the inside of your dwelling place looking like the Taj Mahal in no time at all. Naturally, being house-proud, you find all types of dirt and grime to be essentially abhorrent, to the point of asking your guests to remove their shoes at the door. Unlike other Cancer natives, the admixture of the more upbeat Snake mentality keeps you out of the doldrums for longer periods of time, but it is only reasonable to expect a lapse occasionally. Your lovers shouldn't take your refined surface too much to heart -- there's more to you than that sleek exterior.`,
      leo: `Vanity, vanity, all is vanity -- especially for a Snake/Leo, you good-looking devil. You would never dream of walking out your front door with even a single hair on your head out of its assigned position. In all other matters this attention to detail can flag somewhat, but after all, it's important to prioritize, and you know exactly what -- or, more precisely, who -- to put first in your life. Anyone looking to pry you loose from that Lion of ego you lug around with yourself all day is going to have to offer something even more important to your Snake side, but at this stage, it's hard to imagine what that could be. Try to let your ex-lovers down easy, especially if they've already been replaced and don't know it yet, or you'll have a vendetta on your hands that even the Hatfields and the McCoys wouldn't have envied.`,
      virgo: `Others may accuse the Snake/Virgo of having antifreeze in your veins, but you know that they're just jealous of your superior mental characteristics. A product of two fairly cerebral signs, your entire life revolves around the exercise of logic, so much so sometimes that you have been known to furtively check the tips of your ears to see if they haven't become a bit pointy overnight. Never one to lose your heart or your head, you are nevertheless a good mate, but watch out for a stranger come to sweep your partner away with a bedazzling display of emotion! Not that you're boring -- some people will commit the error of taking you for granted, that's all. Let your heart light shine in the privacy of the bedroom once in a while to forestall such itchy feet on the part of your lover, or else learn to enjoy the taste of humble pie.`,
      libra: `As a Snake/Libra you need never raise your voice, and not because you're an emotionless, unfeeling robot -- as your detractors might see it -- but because you're fully in tune with yourself, evenly balanced as befits your Libran heritage, and, most importantly, impeccably mannered. But manners need an audience for their exercise, and you must make sure to have one on tap at all times, or you'll wilt like grass when the Snake in you is kept too long beneath a flat stone. You can't decide which you like better, attending parties or throwing parties, so you do a great deal of both. You might prefer to have two lovers, one to suit reason and one to suit emotion, so as to maintain the balance mentioned above, but be advised that this is a very tricky business, and that people are harder to balance than one's own psyche. One misstep and your precious equilibrium could be instantly disturbed by breakup proceedings -- or perhaps a simple sock on the jaw, if you've allowed your manners to slip too far.`,
      scorpio: `The Snake/Scorpio is a veritable time bomb ticking. It does most people more harm than good to get too close to you, and the Snake part of you is aware of this, as you are a very private person who has difficulty opening up to just anyone. Possession is your watchword, along with "mine!" Once it's yours, it's yours forever, and if you can't have it, no one can. Unfortunately this possessive attitude extends to affairs of the heart as well, and what you previously lacked in nurturing supportiveness, you more than make up for in flat-out Scorpio rage when everything falls apart. Forgiveness isn't your strong suit -- elaborate plots of revenge may eventually consume what little is left of your love life if you're not careful to defuse this tendency of yours at its source. Life is too short for destructive scenes, and the more you keep that in mind, the happier you'll be.`,
      sagittarius: `The Snake side of your DoubleSign looks before the Sagittarius side leaps -- a very prudent combination. The Snake/Sagittarius has a perceptiveness that is uncanny, and you are very much a "people person" in that you can read everyone around you like a see-through comic book. Because of this enjoyable skill, you may wish to consider a career in psychotherapy. Since your romantic escapades thrive on surprise, however, you'll need to find a partner whom you can't make out with any clarity, as paradoxical as that may sound. Find one like that and you're set for life. Try not to rest on you're laurels too often -- while you're resting, everyone else is out there forging ahead, and you may find yourself further behind than you thought when you again bring your attention to bear upon the race you've chosen to run.`,
      capricorn: `The Snake/Capricorn is very much the lord or the lady of the manor. You have an assumed aristocratic air and all that such a Snake-type heritage entails -- which means expensive taste in all things, coupled with a great distaste for manual labor. How many Snake/Capricorns does it take to screw in a light bulb, you ask? The answer is two: one to call the electrician and one to mix the martinis to drink while they're waiting for the help to arrive. Traditional to the core as only a Capricorn can be, you frown upon modern laxity in standards of dress and conduct, and for your love life see nothing less than a gigantic church wedding -- which can be off-putting for the casual admirer. Some sort of compromise with our modern world might be necessary from time to time if you want to make through life with your sanity, and bank account, intact.`,
      aquarius: `The Snake/Aquarius is a big bundle of contradicting emotions and desires. People have been known to grow frustrated in their attempts to puzzle out the convoluted and self-negating messages that you're constantly sending. You are the sort of lover who is constantly demanding their own freedom, while simultaneously holding their opposite number to a double standard of absolute Snake-style fealty -- "on call" at all hours out of sheer insecurity. It is only through your excellent Aquarian interpersonal communication skills that you can attempt to resolve this interminable battle inside yourself. By explaining what may appear to be a contradiction, you can save yourself and others a great many broken hearts. After all, it's a shame to lose a good relationship just because a few wires got crossed, and you're the only person who can unravel them.`,
      pisces: `Your soft and often sensuous Snake personality demands kid glove treatment from any who might wish to get next to you. The Snake/Pisces impresses easily, which is why strong, brash lovers may maul you unintentionally unless they take steps to handle you with care, as any rare work of art deserves. Try not to become disillusioned when the elaborate fantasy life that you have constructed for yourself comes into contact with a sobering and unaesthetic reality, as it is bound to do from time to time. Your true strength lies in your Piscean ability to navigate the line between the dreaming and the waking worlds. The intuitional skills that make you an excellent operative in this gray zone of the human endeavor also serve you well at any of the various spiritual pastimes that you are habitually engaged in. Beware -- do not call up any that you cannot put down again!`,
    },
    horse: {
      aries: `"Been there, done that" is the battle cry of the Horse/Aries, but this very fact doesn't stop you from looking for newer and more effective ways to stave off your archenemy, boredom. Your Aries side may always have you as busy as the proverbial bee, but take care that you don't switch from flower to flower too quickly, or else you will find yourself with less than your deserved quota of golden pollen jingling in your pockets. Beware of expensive pastimes, too, for they only serve to further divert you from your true work in life. As for your Horse social side, it's a classic case of "so many lovers, so little time." Keep treating affairs of the heart as a smorgasbord and you'll end up starving in the midst of plenty. Try to devote your life to one single unwavering constant goal -- whether it is a job, a lover, or just a good book.`,
      taurus: `The Horse/Taurus has a bad habit of downplaying their obvious qualities. It's no crime to be known for what you're good at, and modesty has no place in today's frenetic job market. Get out there and show them what you're made of! The dependable nature of the Bull has ironed out your natural Horse-born skittishness, but that doesn't mean than you don't like to cut loose once in a while. Seek a lover who prods you on to greater things and won't let you stagnate. You'd stay inside all day if you could -- your home is a substitute for the womb that you can still vaguely remember being so cozy and warm. Don't fret if the world appears larger, colder, and more confusing than you ever imagined it could be -- your concern for security will serve as an involuntary safety net for you in even the direst of circumstances.`,
      gemini: `You've discovered the secret of eternal youth, which to the Horse/Gemini is a ceaseless parade of new thrills, new options, new people and new places. You have a wide range of interests as befits a true scion of the house of the Twins, but few of them extend much deeper than the paper they're printed on. Emotionally immature, you think that everything said or done by others is directed at you in some way, even if it's just an offhand comment uttered by a total stranger on the subway. You are overly sensitive to criticism, and have a hard time holding your imperious Horse-born temper in check when you feel that you've been slighted, which is often. Much of the stress in your life is self-generated due to this curious lack of interpersonal intuition, and you could be at some risk of an early heart attack if you don't manage to cut the rest of the world some slack and reach some kind of detente with what you imagine to be a host of foes.`,
      cancer: `The Horse/Cancer may find itself spending a great deal of time in social situations, browsing through the crowd in search of you know not what, but it'll come to you when you find it. This can lead to a great deal of wasted effort; a little forethought can make the Horse's search a bit more streamlined. You have a great deal of romantic regret dogging you from early life that can only be completely overcome by finding the right person to settle down with in later life, but with your impossibly high standards, that could take a while. In the meantime the Crab in you derives a great deal of satisfaction from taking out your memories, getting maudlin over them for a day or two, and then putting them back into cold storage. You are very fond of what one could call "recreational depression." Don't spend too much time in the past, however --the future beckons, with opportunities that you would be foolish to pass up when they come along.`,
      leo: `Playing the game of patience is not the strong suit of the Horse/Leo, but what you will not allow it to teach you, the trial-and-error method might succeed in forcing through the wall of your indomitable will. After you've had the worst of it a few times, perhaps then you'll learn the value of forethought and careful preparation. In the meantime, you'll simply forge ahead Horse-style, winning some and losing others, but with more wins than losses due to your phenomenal Leo charisma, not to mention your single-minded devotion to your goals. If you want something, you must have it, and no one can stop you -- not even sweet Reason herself. Learn to look before you leap, which is good advice whether you're a Horse or a Lion, but especially good advice if you're both in one hot package. Beware the vice of false modesty -- it is a failing to which you are prone!`,
      virgo: `The most sensible Horse in the entire herd, you have far greater feelings of responsibility to those around you than the average nags in the big rodeo. This makes the Horse/Virgo much sought after as a partner, friend or lover, and you would be wise to decline all but a handful of the most suitable invitations, as you would not wish to spread yourself too thin. Your personal prosperity tends to augment your desirability -- if anything the Virgo in you needs to learn not to convert every single holiday into a working vacation. Leap the fence and roll in the grass once in a long while; it will make you that much better a worker when you're once again harnessed to the plough. You have a tendency to see everything in shades of black and white.`,
      libra: `The Horse/Libra has the great good fortune to be the most physically beautiful of all the DoubleSign combinations. Indeed, there isn't a shop window that you can pass by without glancing into it in order to examine your own reflection. In an age without recognized courtesans, you are an ambulatory Versailles. It will be incumbent upon you to recognize the characteristic vices of the essentially Libran courtesan -- vanity, frippery, cattiness, shallowness -- and neutralize them before they become a way of life for you. Beauty does not necessarily connote idiocy, and you have the potential to absorb a vast amount of knowledge, so don't listen to those who expect you to adhere to a Horsy stereotype, as you will only be limiting what should be a limitless search for perfection in all aspects of your being, not just the physical. In fact, since your body is already perfect, you might want to concentrate on your mind for a while, and put some substance behind what others suspect is merely a facade.`,
      scorpio: `If it weren't for the fact that your Horse aspect allows your Scorpio aspect to admit a touch of self-deprecatory humor now and then, you'd have vibrated yourself to death with suppressed rage long ago. As it stands, your lightness of demeanor will stand you in good stead, even if your drive and competitiveness are enough for others to label the Horse/Scorpio as "pushy" from time to time. Ignore them -- is it your fault that you know exactly what you want and will brook no distractions? Romantically speaking, you're quite the seductive one, and can wrap anyone around your little finger with the minimum of proper effort. The only problem is that you may not want the ones who fall so easily -- they reveal their essential weakness by succumbing to your charms, and you cannot respect weak individuals. Watch for the one who holds out the longest against your siren song, and when they do eventually wind up in your arms, gather them in gently and keep them forever. They'll be happy to stick around.`,
      sagittarius: `No one can shout you down -- the Horse/Sagittarius is the loudest voice in the choir. Assertive and independent, you take no prisoners and ask for no mercy in return. Your straightforward Horsy ways can appear boorish to those who have just met you. You live fast, and if you haven't died young, then at least the recklessness and extravagance of your youth has died with your youth, and good riddance! You need to concentrate in order to stay the course, and it will take a lover of great strength to provide you with this paramount ability. You will spend most of your life in fighting your curiously resistant juvenile addiction to junk food, but luckily your active lifestyle (a standard Sagittarius accessory) won't allow it to leave too many marks upon your generally pleasing physique.`,
      capricorn: `Industrious and thrifty, the Horse/Capricorn actually enjoys work, and feels the sensation of the grindstone du jour as a delightful tickling. You're very much the eternal "square" type -- you're practical and energetic, an attentive parent and loving spouse, for it stands to reason that you're not much of a social butterfly, what with all of those Capricorn characteristics mitigating against such a trait. You prefer to seek employment in those professions having to do with science and technology. Should the brutal truth be told, you'd be perfect if you weren't so dull and boring. Break free of your routine once in a while, for the sake of everyone around you (and the Horse half within you, too). A mate who is able to get you to shake off the yoke of seriousness is worth his or her weight in solid gold, so should a person like that happen by, do not hesitate to take happenstance up on the opportunity that it was so gracious as to bestow upon you.`,
      aquarius: `At worst, the Horse/Aquarius is an irritable crank, but you're rarely at your worst, so don't worry too much about those tendencies. Instead, concentrate on the positive, which is that at your best, you are a dazzling, extravagant eccentric with one ear cocked for what the future has to tell you. Bold leaps of intuition that transcend mere logic are your Aquarian specialty. You have a calculated disdain for things of the material world, and your goals are far loftier than the mere accumulation of wealth. Any potential significant others will have to take your Horsy high-mindedness and impracticality into account, as they will be unable to change you no matter how hard they may try -- a true lover won't even try very hard. But you may have to go though a few disappointments before you can find one who'll be able to keep up with you every step of the way.`,
      pisces: `What to do to keep yourself from being taken advantage of by others? For that is the Horse/Pisces' major weak spot, and it will take much tempering by time to lessen this vulnerability of yours. For you are adrift in a sea of romance (courtesy of your Piscean side), and tend to view everyone's motives through the same lens that colors your own. You are the consummate rationalizer, even when you're unaware that that is indeed what you're doing. Your love life seems to have a mind and heart of its own, and has a habit of leaving strange gifts on your doorstep in the middle of the night. Try not to depend too much on any other person, and instead develop the hitherto untapped reserves of self-reliance that are your Horse half's birthright. The only thing keeping you from self-actualization is your self-indulgent lassitude. Shake off that half-awake state and give yourself a good talking-to -- it'll make things easier later on, for all concerned.`,
    },
    goat: {
      aries: `Leadership by stealth is the stock in trade of the Goat/Aries. You are so very good at manipulating people that they often don't realize that you're the one who's pulling their strings. This strategy of yours serves the purpose of making sure that you get the correct information regarding the situation, as people will only communicate truthfully with those who they consider their equals, even if your Aries will brook no rivals. Be sure not to let any such Goat-inspired self-effacement get out of hand, however, or else others will step in and take all the credit for your bold and sweeping reforms. Be at the right place at the right time and credit will be assigned where it is rightfully due. The puppetry act may be superfluous when it comes to the bedroom -- try to be more forthright with the one you love and trust, no matter how difficult it becomes to wear your heart on your sleeve.`,
      taurus: `By the time the Goat/Taurus makes that last big score, it could be too late -- try to stop and eat the roses along the path. Don't let your Taurean need to be cosseted like an infant lull your mind into a state of retrograde infancy. Use your comfortable situation as a stepping-stone to a higher goal; your game plan has been mapped out for some time now, so you should know which step to take next. Find the mate who's willing to cater to your every need, and marry without delay, as you were never intended to play the field, what with your elaborate Goat-born system of reciprocated needs and wants. You may prove to be too demanding for the casual lover, so get used to a few false starts before you actually begin your choreographed march to the velvet altar. Beware the temptations of stagnation!`,
      gemini: `The Goat/Gemini will talk a good game about "needing your space," but in reality you need people around you at all times, and not just any people, the right people -- that is, people who will provide input for your rapacious sense of ego. You need to feel connected, and any medium of communication will serve to dispel your sense of isolation -- phone, internet, even television are better than being left alone to listen to the hollow repetition of your own Gemini fears. Even with a durable partner by your side, you'll feel compelled to stray from time to time, because no one person could ever quench your insatiable need for love or appreciate half of the facets that make up your clever but flighty personality. This sort of Goatish self-absorption may serve you well, should you attempt a career in the performing arts.`,
      cancer: `Some people are actually good with children, and the Goat/Cancer is at the top of the list for this socially useful talent. Nor is working with them day in and day out good enough to suit you -- you've got to go and fill your house with them! Definitely the marrying kind, you are a kind, frail, loving person who needs extra-special care to spare your sensitive soul from the harsh realities of the world. You seek a partner that can help you insulate the pair of you within a perfect Cancerian cocoon of home life. You don't like to think about many of the more unpleasant aspects of today's world -- you operate under the vague assumption that they just won't apply to you and yours if you work hard enough to make everything cozy and safe. You may be right about this after all, so don't let the Goat in you worry so much or you'll be seeing dangers that aren't there, and never have a moment's peace. You're doing everything that's humanly possible, and your family, natural or artificial, will respond with much reciprocated affection.`,
      leo: `The Goat/Leo's furious pursuit of the finer things in life may short-circuit itself if you spend too much time living for the moment and not enough time living for the moment after that. A touch of forethought will save you a great deal of work, which should bring you great joy as you tend to be a bit relaxed for sweatshop labor. Your constant Leonine need for the best of everything can prove to be a brake that drains away your momentum, as you may refuse to move at all if not properly funded. Learn to operate under less close tolerances, and you will be able to accomplish more with what you have on hand. After all, not everyone will be keen to make exceptions in your case, and you cannot go through life with the Goat in you relying on the kindness of strangers, for quite often they have none. Better to rely upon your own inner reserves of kindness instead, whether directed inward or outward.`,
      virgo: `Uh-oh --what we have here in the Goat/Virgo is a species of the most exacting perfectionist the DoubleSign zodiac has to offer. If it isn't utterly flawless, it just won't do for you. You cannot stand the slightest Goat-induced mistake on your own part, and you are utterly merciless when it comes to the quirks and foibles of others. This doesn't exactly tend to make you popular, and your finicky Virgo selection process has time and again deprived you of above-average lovers with one slight blemish to instantly disqualify them in your romantic eyes. If you wish to be truly perfect, consider this: a harsh and impossible standard of perfection is itself an imperfection for those who adhere to it. To be truly perfect, one must also possess a degree of tolerance and mercy. Good luck improving yourself!`,
      libra: `It's hard for the Goat/Libra to decide whether or not you're good at making decisions, which, in a way, says it all right there about that particular aspect of your personality. Creative and superbly in tune with your intuition thanks to your Libran heritage, you'll make a great artist if encouraged in that direction by a select coterie of followers. Don't burn your capacity out overnight -- you've only got so much energy to go around, and you don't work at all well under deadline pressure. For the occasional crise de nerfs you need a partner whose subtle strengths bolster you without redefining your essentially impressionable self-image. Try not to take their much-needed support for granted Goat-style; otherwise your happy household could spin apart under the impetus of its own centrifugal force.`,
      scorpio: `Being one of these fascinating Goat/Scorpios is a little like being one of those hologram cards that you tilt one way to see one design and tilt the other way to see a completely different design. On the outside, you appear to be Goatishly frail and in need of the greatest possible protective treatment. Inside, you're a howling wind of warring Scorpio passions. Just let an intimate make one false step and it's all over -- look out for the explosion! In your blind fury you may verge on overkill when it comes to avenging perceived wrongs. It is incumbent upon you to learn some sense of proportion before it's too late. The loss of all self-control means nothing for you but a precipitous descent into the uttermost depths of loneliness -- and that you absolutely cannot abide.`,
      sagittarius: `Be prepared to intuit your way straight from rags to riches, if you happen to have the good luck to belong to the carefree Goat/Sagittarius DoubleSign. Your trademark Sagittarian approach to both business and pleasure lies in a sort of dimly sensed yet eerily accurate instinct that tells you every move to make before you make it. Coupled with your moneymaking powers, you might consider a career as a stockbroker, accountant, lawyer or other big-business type of person. With you bringing home the bacon, it's only natural to expect a more stable mate, equipped with a vast amount of patience with your antics, to look after your more mundane needs and generally pick up after you around the house. You'll more than make it worth their while -- your generous Goat nature is so ingrained that you have even distributed largesse to honored enemies on occasion.`,
      capricorn: `On the outside the Goat/Capricorn is very much the business-suited Capricorn professional. But you lead an entire secret Goat-style life on the sly that only a very few intimates are ever made aware of. You prefer to separate your life into its private and public spheres, and furthermore you prefer to keep those two spheres rigorously separate from each other. You may be an actuary by day, and by night write sumptuous poetry, or indulge in pleasures of the flesh that your cohorts at the office only wish they had the nerve to sample. It is this wonderfully rich undercover existence that allows you to hold your head up high as you define for yourself a unique and excited personal existence, separate from -- and far superior to -- that of the common herd. Who cares if no one else but you knows of these accomplishments? You know, and that is enough.`,
      aquarius: `The Goat/Aquarius lives in the eternal "now," and that can be both a blessing and a curse for those who know you. You're a tough act to follow, and you seem to change your attitudes towards life as easily as your clothes. The Goat in you is nearly impossible to pin down. A social kaleidoscope, you associate with the most varied people, at all hours, and belong at any table where you choose to pull up a chair. You specialize in interpersonal shock tactics, and as a child of Aquarius there's nothing you love better than a good bout of "freaking the mundanes." In return it takes an awful lot to make you drop your jaw, for you've seen it all, done it all, and are constantly active inventing new wrinkles on what is to be seen and done. It takes a certain special talent to live more in a weekend than others do during an entire lifetime, but that talent you appear to have mastered.`,
      pisces: `The Goat/Pisces is a delight to be around; you are the honey to which the hummingbirds fly in order to gorge themselves. Sweet and ethereal, your entire soul oozes beauty, truth, and other mainstays of the poetic Piscean tradition. You aren't what one might call a ball of fire, but then again, you don't need to be -- your innocence and helplessness inspires everyone around you to do your bidding without you doing much more than to blow the occasional kiss and heave the occasional sigh, all while languidly waving that peacock-feather fan of yours. It's delightful to live a kept life, but be sure to put something away for tomorrow, because the things of the body are transient, and someday your steady source of ardent lovers may not be there to cushion the impact of the rest of reality. A habit of dependence (a la Goat) is seldom lost, once gained.`,
    },
    monkey: {
      aries: `The Monkey/Aries is quite the chatterbox, and this unique ability to communicate at high volume (in both senses of the word) is both the blessing and the bane of your existence. It's easy for you to make friends and influence people -- just sidle up and say whatever comes next, whether it's at the bar or behind the podium. Have no fear; the words will always come naturally to you. If anything, you need to learn how to sit down and keep your mouth shut once in a while. Quiet observation may show you that which the Aries in you has been running yourself ragged seeking since the day you were born. Beware the vice of a too easily satisfied boredom! The quest for distraction may prove to be the biggest distraction imaginable for you, as for all Monkeys, and may keep you from accomplishing that which you regard as your purpose here on earth.`,
      taurus: `No soppy displays of public affection for the Monkey/Taurus; you want a lover who can keep their distance and bombard you with scintillating wit -- so much so that you don't even mind playing the "straight man" once in a while. You Monkey's penchant for bouncing off the walls is mediated somewhat by your dependable Bull patrimony, which makes you reliable when it comes to long-term projects. Rather than conflicting, your two disparate halves combine to make a well-modulated and seamless whole. Be sure to maintain your youthful zest for all that life has to offer well into middle age, or else you'll run the risk of settling down into the cold comfort of a stodgy conformity. Don't be afraid to shake the cobwebs loose from the rafters once in a while -- a long, long while.`,
      gemini: `If it weren't for the difficulty the Monkey/Gemini's audience faces in keeping up with the thousand-miles-a-second pace you set, you'd never stay in one place long enough for anyone to get close to you, and that would be a tragedy -- you're at your Gemini sleekest with at least one confidant to tell you how good you look all the time. This will not stop you from amassing the wealth of secondary friends and acquaintances that are necessary for your inner Monkey to function, of course, especially at the endless series of social gatherings where you feel obliged to put in an appearance. Try to impress upon yourself a modicum of self-control, for if you don't no one else will -- they'll be too busy laughing at your antics to detect the crying clown behind the facade of gala buffoonery.`,
      cancer: `No monkey business here -- the Monkey/Cancer is a human computer. Your vast array of mental skills include a memory retention rate (inherited from your Crab side) that is quite dizzying and is best used to its full potential in arbitrage or actuarial positions, rather than to impress new faces at cocktail parties with endless streams of fascinating and useless trivia. Chess is far and away your favorite game. You have a preternatural talent for the manipulation of numbers (born of your Monkey's facility with games), and any sort of trick or puzzle that can be solved with a pen is open season for you, including crossword puzzles. If all of the above makes it sound like you don't get out much, it's because you don't. Fun for you begins and ends in the safe confines of your home, where you can control access to yourself and your precious allotments of quality time. You're smart enough to know not to squander yourself on incidentals.`,
      leo: `Have you ever seen the Marx Brothers movie Monkey Business? Well, guess who landed the starring role? That's right -- the Monkey/Leo is the big winner! You crave attention and will do anything to get it with your Monkey-shines, which may result in your acquiring an, ahem, eccentric reputation about town if you don't use a little common sense from time to time. Don't let your frenetic lust for novelty separate you from those who might be willing to get to know you a little bit better, and don't be afraid of commitment when the time is right. Do be afraid of your atrocious Leonine lack of tidiness, however -- you're the sort of person who will leave pizza crust under the sofa and watermelon rinds under the bed to fester for months. Beware of too much disorder in your life!`,
      virgo: `Whether mapping a printed circuit or tatting a doily, the Monkey/Virgo prefers detail-oriented hands-on work when it comes to your choice of profession. The classic perfection of the Virgo half of your DoubleSign manifests itself in the Monkey's endless love of time-consuming distraction, which serves for you as a source of both fun and profit. In the arena of romance you may be passing over perfectly good lovers due to a hypertrophied sense of absolute perfection. It's time for you to learn that no one's perfect. Lighten up and let someone in, before it's too late, or you may find yourself late in life with nothing to show for your choosiness than a couple of dozen of the world's most impeccably groomed cats with which to while away the evening hours.`,
      libra: `The Monkey/Libra should be sure to channel their industrious output of word-based art into something remunerative like advertising copywriting -- it's glib, it's witty, it's memorable, but that may not make it fine art. When it comes to you, be sure to write it down quickly, and always keep a pad and pencil near the bed for those midnight bursts of divine Libran inspiration. Speaking of which, as long as you think their pants off beforehand, you can get almost anybody to come across with a little loving, but making actual contact between minds might take a little extra effort that you may not be up to. Excess Monkey superficiality may be a boon at the office, but it can also typecast you among your social circle as merely just another pretty face if you keep your super fine mind too closely guarded.`,
      scorpio: `Lying, cheating and stealing? Certainly not! The Monkey/Scorpio prefers the words embellishing, streamlining and borrowing, but what's in a word? Self-control is not your strong suit, but you'd better learn some fast or you may find yourself operating on the wrong side of the law before you know it. The Scorpio admixture tends to bring out the Monkey's dishonest side, and we all know this crafty simian can be the rudest beast in the zoo if not kept on a tight leash. As far as the person on the other end of that leash, you should see to it that they bring to the partnership a strong and vibrant personality of their own, as clashes are almost guaranteed, and you can't abide a pushover when it comes to a contest of wills. Perhaps you should consider a career in international espionage!`,
      sagittarius: `Try to forget the capricious passions of your wayward youth -- that's all in the past now. The Monkey/Sagittarius' fundamental rebellion against the time clock has continued, however, and you are better off in a less structured job environment, perhaps running your own small business, or going in for freelance assignments; telecommuting was made for the Monkey in you. Your visionary approach to projects can be sabotaged by your lack of both confidence and concentration without a pep talk now and then. Beware the floating mind! An excellent choice for a life partner is one who can help you keep both feet firmly anchored to the ground, for when you are in danger of dissipating your Sagittarian energies throughout the unappreciative skies, with little or no reward for your pains.`,
      capricorn: `The Monkey/Capricorn's greatest asset is your sense of rhythm as it applies to time and place. In the more literal sense, this can make you one of the all-time greats in any professional sport that may require such as sense, like basketball for instance. In a more representational sense, this could lead you to become a musician, percussion or otherwise -- or perhaps a stand-up comedian, with your exquisite Monkey-inspired knowledge of where to drop the punch line so as to extract full effect from the joke. Romantically, too, you're right on time, but watch out for those who are just coming off of prior bad relationships. These may prove to be your Achilles' heel, for while vulnerable at first, they may come to take up too much of your precious time and eventually disturb your equally precious personal equilibrium, so important to your Capricorn side.`,
      aquarius: `The Monkey/Aquarius is always picking things apart to find out their root cause, primary drive, or single smallest component, and this characteristic may make some of your less inquisitive acquaintances uncomfortable, especially when it applies to impolite social topics (your Aquarius side loves to shock). This is not to say that you should curtail your investigative Monkey-style activities, just cloak them in a mantle of silence until all is in readiness. You may want to spare some though as to what to do with the answers once you've found them -- after all, that's a great deal of time and effort to waste if there's no return! The entertainment possibilities of acquired knowledge are not lost on you -- if anything, you may be lost within them if your taste for intellectual self-indulgence at last manages to get the better of you.`,
      pisces: `The innate sensitivity of the Fishes combined with the clever Monkey's penchant for fabrication can result in some of the most beautiful lies ever crafted by humans -- in other words, novels. The Monkey/Pisces may wish to consider a career in literature. But don't wait too long, as indecision is you abiding vice and you have a tendency to sit on the fence longer than it may be happy or healthy for you to do so. There is also the question of your personal integrity to consider, as some lies may give birth to a series of other lies, until inside of you there may be no truth left at all for a sincere and caring partner to sense and feel secure with. It is important for you not to fall into the trap of actually believing your own personal propaganda. Beware the inability to discern fact from fiction!`,
    },
    rooster: {
      aries: `The Rooster/Aries prefers to name names and damn the consequences. Your at times excessive Roosterian candor and forthrightness could land you in hot water in the wrong company -- make sure you don't let vital information slip to possible enemies! You are an inveterate hobbyist, but take care not to lump your significant other in with the model trains and the ships in bottles, as they will demand an equal or greater share of your attention at any given moment. Your scope of activity gives you the Aries-born ability to in effect live several lives simultaneously, thereby packing more thrills into one lifetime than others could possibly encounter in a dozen lifetimes. Moderation is the key here, however -- beware the seductive thrill of working yourself into an early grave!`,
      taurus: `Work now and ask questions later! In fact, why are you even wasting your time reading this when you have that deadline staring you in the face? The take-no-prisoners attitude of the Rooster has goaded the Bull into frenetic activity in the Rooster/Taurus' parallel quest for success and excellence. Winning isn't enough for you -- you have to win in exactly the right way, with everything just so. The wrong sort of success won't cut the mustard. Despite your outer shell of abrupt mannerisms, a persevering lover can melt through this coating of hard chocolate to find the soft liquid center, if you'll give them a chance and knock off work early on Fridays for a change of pace. The kind of love that money can buy won't do you any good at all.`,
      gemini: `Mutual respect can be a tricky balance to achieve in any relationship, but for the Rooster/Gemini it's more difficult than for most. While you despise weakness in your lovers and absolutely cannot tolerate any clinging dishrags, you also can't stand being ordered around like a galley slave -- your Gemini's reasoning being that if you wanted things that way, you'd enlist and at least get paid for your servitude. Your major flaw lies in your Rooster-born tendency to rely on your own commanding presence to bully people into doing it your way or hitting the highway. This can insulate you from your co-workers, if nothing else. Conversations with you have a habit of degenerating into gale-force arguments when no one is paying attention, because of your irrepressible combative streak.`,
      cancer: `The Rooster/Cancer means well, but when you attempt to communicate your feelings you have a tendency to leave the "well" by the wayside and come across as just plain mean. Your abrasive Rooster's tongue has a smooth side, too, and can be used to sandpaper over any flaws that may arise in the surface of your domestic relationships. You are house-proud to a fault, but you don't think so, since it's obvious to you that, as a Gemini, you have no faults at all. Be sure to allow equal time for opposing views, and stop treating every independent opinion around you as a species of personal treason. Your housemates will thank you for it, just as they thank you for picking up after them constantly. You are powerless to control your insistence on a clean and tidy environment -- ever consider a career in medicine?`,
      leo: `Oh boy -- the Rooster/Leo is a manic-depressive cannonball of a personality, so everybody around you had better look out! Check in the mirror and see what kind of a day you're having -- it might not be advisable to walk out that door just yet. Your fits of moody misbehavior are what render you irresistible to your romantic opposite, as paradoxical as that may sound (to everyone but a Leo). They need you to play the "bad seed," and since this is the core of your character you are more than happy to oblige them. If the gloom gets too thick, seek hugs of a non-sexual nature for instant cheer. It is advisable to spend less time crowing about your Roosterian greatness and more time actually achieving great things, for, as they say on the radio, all talk is cheap.`,
      virgo: `It's easy to offend the Rooster/Virgo, and you might want to consider the development of a protective layer of emotional callus to lessen such tendencies. If you can't, then be sure to get it out in the open right away, instead of following your usual tried-and-true Virgo's method, which entails letting all the little irks and slights build up inside, hidden, until finally the pressure become too great and you simply explode with fury -- usually at some poor innocent who just happened to be passing by and has absolutely no idea what's going on in your head. You've had to mend more fences because of unfortunate outbursts like that -- where else would the Rooster in you sit otherwise? You view yourself as calm, cool and collected -- it sounds better in your ears than the label of "slowpoke" flung at you by more active detractors.`,
      libra: `Unbridled passion is not the forte of the Rooster/Libra; yours is a quieter brand of affection. You have been accused of being aloof and standoffish, but can you help it if you prefer not to associate with certain types of undesirables? You are unforgiving in your Libran requirements of order and beauty amid the chaos and ugliness of this world. It is advisable for you to spend less time demanding and more time creating, as nothing creates nothing and even order needs a germ from which to grow. Spare a thought for the organization, because you know that if the Rooster in you doesn't, nobody else will either. Despite this aura of stuffiness that you carefully cultivate, you are susceptible to emotional disarray from time to time that may well hurl a spanner into the clockwork of your well-groomed reality.`,
      scorpio: `The Rooster/Scorpio's insatiable drive crushes all before it, friend and foe alike. You don't have many of the former due to their incredibly high casualty rate, and you don't have many of the latter because you mow them down like chaff at every chance you get. If you don't ease up and cut some corners once in a while you're going to end up in the trunk of a car with six bullets in your head. No one really believes that you're chicken, so stop trying to prove your bad Rooster self time and time again -- we get the point already! You'll never find the perfect partner you've been searching for unless you tone down your Scorpion-generated intensity a notch or two. Until then you'll just keep scaring everyone away with the spooky amplitude of your overflowing heart.`,
      sagittarius: `You cannot tell a lie, or at least, you cannot tell a lie that sounds like a lie, although you wish you could. The honesty of the Rooster/Sagittarius, though greatly valued by others (especially your adversaries), is the bane of your existence. Luckily, you are a bundle of incurable typical Sagittarian optimism, so this doesn't bother you as much as it would a different DoubleSign. Try to figure out the mannered anodyne of the "white lie" -- it'll spare your relationships many an unintentional headache. Be sure to separate the water from the oil when it comes to doling out charity, and give of your Roosterian plenitude only to the truly needy, otherwise word will make the rounds and they'll come from far and wide to drag you and your giving nature down into the depths with them, which will severely hamper your ability to remain cheerful.`,
      capricorn: `The Rooster/Capricorn is a living portrait of grace under pressure. The word "unflappable" springs to mind when people look at you, and you prefer to be known by it -- it connotes strength of character, a quality by which you as a Capricorn swear. Sure, you'll never be the life of the party, but who needs that? While everyone else is out wasting their time, you're busy clawing your way to the top of the heap, or indeed several heaps simultaneously. Power is a necessary corollary to your Rooster-born leadership skills, and you may live long enough to have the distinct satisfaction of pronouncing sentence upon those who in the past once mocked you for your unerring work ethic. Somewhere in your town sits a street just waiting to be named after you, and after all your civic boosterism, it'll be a reward well merited.`,
      aquarius: `The Rooster/Aquarius needs a lover that will drive you crazy trying to decode the inner workings of their cryptogram of a soul. You're like that -- curiosity wrapped in the swaddling clothes of popular mysticism, a la Aquarius. You may be inclined to dabble in the paranormal, and if you can earn a living by it, why not? You specialize and delight in trashing the old-fashioned and in classic Rooster style trumpeting the praises of the new, and when you feel the tug of memory playing about your heartstrings, you shrug it off, because sentiment is for the senile. Take the time to play with your victims before you claim them -- you could learn a great deal from clandestine interrogation. Don't linger before your mirror -- someday, if you're grievously unlucky, there may not be a reflection there to greet you in the morning.`,
      pisces: `The Rooster/Pisces has a curiously unimaginative flair for the truly romantic, sprung from the Fishes and compounded of what you've read in books: long walks on the beach, dozens of roses, candle-lit midnight dinners, etc., etc. It has landed you your share of conquests, to be sure, but try a little variation along with the tenderness and see where it leads you. If there were anything about you that could do with a little adjusting, it would be your tendency to trumpet your own praises across the land (like any good Rooster). Humility is endless -- better get cracking. Steady employment isn't important to you, and for this reason you can get along just fine at nearly any job out there. You are a jack-of-all-trades, and you've also managed to master one or two of the along the way. If worst comes to worst, you may wish to consider working for an escort service, as you've got looks that could easily qualify.`,

    dog: {
      aries: `Secure in their abilities, the Dog/Aries DoubleSign has the stern self-assurance necessary to break away from the pack at an early age and just keep right on going off on their own tangent. A quasi-mystical Canine belief in "twinned souls separated at creation" may keep you shopping around the meat market for some time, but when you end up striking gold you'll know that your labors were not in vain. Some may quail at your austere insistence on the eternal verities of life, so try not to let the Ram in you ride your friends and lovers too hard for their inconstancy -- they can't help it, but you can. Resist the urge to play matchmaker, for both parties will resent such an intrusion and you may instead put the kibosh on the whole deal inadvertently.`,
      taurus: `The Dog/Taurus' sober, commanding dignity of bearing may scare away those who would be romantically inclined, if it weren't for their secret fear of not measuring up to your high standards. A pragmatist by virtue of your Bullish heritage, you insist on having things done right the first time, which in practice translates out as having things done your way, all the time. You don't work well as part of a team because you usually shove everyone else aside, do all the work yourself, and then let everyone bask in the shared credit, a process that can understandably rile the Dog in you after it's been repeated two or three times with the same group. You don't mind getting your hands dirty, but you'll be the first in line for the sink when it's time to wash up afterwards.`,
      gemini: `The Dog/Gemini's wanderings are modulated and conform to a pattern that is predictable to the knowing eye -- the avoidance of the unpleasant. It's really as simple as that. You don't like being couch-bound; a regular exercise regimen is recommended, and indeed preferred by that Gemini athlete in you. That indescribable quantity that you're searching for can never and will never be found, but don't let that discourage you -- while your Dog half has you out scouring the surface of the earth, so many other worthwhile experiences will pop up and shake hands with you that your endless peregrinations will be well worth the occasional spot of trouble along the route. Beware the lover who refuses to share all -- they're not strong enough to run your course with you, and will abandon you at the first obstacle.`,
      cancer: `The cerebral quality of your musings is one common to all Crabs, but your down-to-earth Dog heritage gives you ability to bring your schemes to three-dimensional life, in a form that is pleasing to the eye. The Dog/Cancer individual may want to consider a career as an interior decorator, seeing as how you're a home-oriented person with a discreet aesthetic sense when it comes to the proper furnishings. Be sure not to stumble over a rock while watching the sunset. Shy and withdrawn, it may be difficult for you to "get out there" and make yourself known to that special someone, but rest assured, you're such a valuable property that "special someones" galore are right this minute heading for your front door, step by amorous step.`,
      leo: `The Dog/Leo may be crispy on the outside, but they're chewy on the inside, eaten up as they are by a veritable army marshaled by fear and staffed by voracious, bickering particles of self-doubt. You're going to need someone who can take you out of yourself and make you forget your sense of Canine inadequacy, and then send you in to conquer with banners flying Leo-style! In the meantime, try not to huddle in the fetal position with your hands over your head. After all, it takes bravado to make bravado, and you'll soon find that if you can make yourself believe, others will fall into line with no problem. In fact, your ex-humble stance can serve as a sort of social Trojan Horse in times of dire need. They'll think they've cornered a mangy mongrel, but when they hear that roar of yours they'll scatter like frightened birds!`,
      virgo: `The weight of the world rests on the Dog/Virgo's shoulders, and to you it feels just fine. After all, if you don't take care of everybody, who will? Be careful not to allow your tendency to focus on the abstract ideal (like a typical Virgo) of loving all of humanity sideline your more mundane and practical efforts to help the bum on the corner. You're a born Canine worrier, but that's how you get things done, so this tendency shouldn't add to your worries. Quiet and reserved, you're vulnerable to a more experienced lover, should your paths cross. Just don't let early disappointments leave your emotions a scored mass of twisted scar tissue -- there will be plenty of other chances to find the right person, and one bad apple doesn't necessarily mean the entire bushel has gone bad.`,
      libra: `Faultfinder, faultfinder, find me a fault! The Dog/Libra's critical eye could spot a strand of hay in a stack of needles. Better learn to find a compromise with this grubby existence, or else get used to those frown lines. The right person could vindicate all of your high Libran expectations, if you can manage to recognize that individual when you meet them, instead of being put off by the fact that their socks don't match. The Dog in you needs to be shown that although sex and love are two different things, they can combined in the same relationship -- the process may take a while, so don't send out those wedding invitations just yet. Extend your universal sense of justice to include those closest to you, leavened with a heaping helping of good old-fashioned mercy, and they'll never let you down.`,
      scorpio: `The strong moral conviction of the Dog/Scorpio as to what is right may bear some re-examination before too long. Pay more attention to the spirit of the law and less attention to its harsh lettering. You have a cruel and selfish Scorpio streak mixed in with your ministrations of Canine kindness -- that's why some of your beneficiaries don't thank you as promptly or as sincerely as you might like. Be watchful of your own motives, as you are the worst enemy of your best intentions, and be sure to turn that camera eye upon yourself. Don't miss the mote for the beam. Nobody will laugh at you if you decide to put your feet up on the coffee table for a while -- in fact, they may be silently holding their breath, praying that you'll reveal to them the person inside that rusty old armor.`,
      sagittarius: `Don't go so far as to try to catch a Frisbee in your teeth, but to all lesser extents an interest in physical exercise is definitely encouraged. The Dog/Sagittarius should let their play become their work ever so slowly, without relinquishing a sense of fun -- which can be life sustaining both for your inner Dog and for all the others who count on you to show them how to have a good time. If you're feeling painted into a corner, then climb out the window and run like a Sagittarius before it's too late and the walls start closing in. You'll wish you could go back to school and stay there forever, but this cannot be done, for time cannot be frozen, and you're just wise enough to have that particular truism tattooed on your very bones. Beware keeping company with one who lives all their life in childhood!`,
      capricorn: `As a Dog/Capricorn, you're a boring prude. No, seriously -- if your Capricorn side doesn't uncross those legs and live a little, you might as well climb into your coffin fully dressed. The years have flown past, and what have you done with them? You're a wearer of whalebone corsets and steel-ribbed girdles in an era of frilly lace garter belts. You've got the basic material, so feel free to shake it all around. Your family will understand -- they love you, after all, even if you don't pay much attention to their quiet regard. You have a tendency to intimidate others into an unwonted silence because of your own Doggedly taciturn manner. Your children will be goaded into early rebellion by your staid ways, so look out for the ever-widening generation gap to come! Candy and flowers could go a long way towards quelling signs of romantic unrest.`,
      aquarius: `The Dog/Aquarius has the enviable ability to extract the maximum amount of effect from the minimum amount of raw material. You could craft a gourmet meal out of bulgur wheat, unflavored gelatin and leftover tuna casserole, thanks to your native Aquarian resourcefulness. You could fly to the moon on a single tank of unleaded gasoline. But just because you can doesn't mean you will -- there will come a point in your life when you'll have had enough of your hand-to-mouth existence, and it's then that you'll be glad you had the foresight to squirrel away a few nuts for your winter of ease and luxury. Forget your forethought and it will take care of you in an unconscious manner. Your love life consists of taking Dog-inspired pity upon those you feel are less fortunate than yourself. Beware this habit, for pity is not love, and cannot replace it!`,
      pisces: `The least little thing will set the Dog/Pisces' alarm bells ringing, but that's because your immediate environment is meticulously organized (as befits a true Pisces) and you can unerringly tell when the order has been disturbed. You pride yourself upon your Doglike devotion to your family, and point to the secure existence that you have brought into being, unaware that many within in might prefer to characterize it as a carpeted coffin, and be dying to escape its confines. The quality of love cannot be constrained, so you'll simply have to let go for a while. Don't worry, they'll be back. If you'll calm down a notch or two, you'll find that the necessities of life come easy, and maybe then you'll be able to sip from the glass of satisfaction at a job well done.`,
    },
    pig: {
      aries: `The Pig/Aries is very much a creature of the body. Nothing can undermine your essentially cheerful nature, unless of course you are deprived of your Porcine creature comforts. Don't confuse your needs with your wants, and don't let the lack of what are fundamentally minor aspects in your life prevent you from attempting that which may initially seem impossible to any but the Ram in you. It is recommended that you "rough it" from time to time to reappraise what the material world truly has to offer you. Listen to advice from any of many friends who care to offer it -- they may know something that you don't. Love is the answer to a question you haven't yet asked, and it may require a tremendous stretch of the imagination to recognize it in your current surroundings.`,
      taurus: `Be not flagging in thy determination, o Pig/Taurus -- not with the solid-as-a-rock Bull behind you to back you up. You never falter, just fall back and retrench every now and then. A Porcine taste for the good life is the carrot that you keep ahead of your eyes at all times, and never mind the cruel stick of ambition lambasting you from behind. Don't worry, you'll get there eventually -- the copious amounts of midnight oil that you've burned away will mean rich dividends in later life. You inner perversity will enrich your love life to such an extent that you'll never, ever be bored for a single instant beneath those rich satin sheets of yours. Be sure to read the manual before attempting anything difficult or potentially harmful in the sack.`,
      gemini: `The Pig/Gemini is quite the freewheeling mesomorph, but beware! Your Porcine love of fine food and expensive beverages will result in the inevitable spare tire unless you make a point of doing a few sit-ups at the gym before it's too late. Remember how hard it is to lose it once you've gained it -- and this goes double for your sketchy reputation in affairs of the heart. Try not to hit them with it all at once, but keep the lines of communication open to your Gemini side in case of future developments. Always maintain that strategic reserve. Look beneath that glamorous exterior to truly judge whether or not you belong with that person, or disappointment will be your lot. Your flair for presentation may draw you into a career in catering or hotel management.`,
      cancer: `The Pig/Cancer is so happy all of the time that every other DoubleSign envies you, without giving you the satisfaction of telling you so to your face. The smallest things will keep you glowing throughout the day -- especially children, and the more the merrier. Your house resounds with the pitter-patter of little feet, which, as your inner Crab has gleefully accepted, is the inevitable result of an unquenchable Porcine thirst for the pleasures of the honeymoon suite. You may be content with letting everyone else score their successes while you waver in the wings, but don't let it keep you too far in the margin -- you need a thing or two to point to and say, "I did this. That's all mine. Nobody else can claim it." When you've got that one thing, the rest will cease to trouble you. `,
      leo: `The Pig/Leo might as well have their onstage debut as soon as possible, since they've been playing to a crowded house for years. Your zany and colorful spirit uplifts and invigorates all those who are lucky enough to have some claim to your attentions. Don't let your Leo half be accused of being a prima donna -- share the spotlight with someone else once in a while. Don't ever dream of growing up, either, since it's your rare and wonderful child's (read: Pig's) sensibility extrapolated into adult life that keeps them coming back for more. Beware the sour sting of dashed hopes -- just because it didn't work out once doesn't mean it will never work out ever again! You are prone to a dash of sulkiness that others find oddly attractive, but you have a hard time showing them that you really mean it.`,
      virgo: `The strictness of your Virgo antecedents can ameliorate your oriental Pig side's tendency to overindulge in matters of the table, so you needn't bother yourself with that gym membership just yet, although later in life the Pig/Virgo's gourmand's ways will catch up to you in the form of an unwanted stomach. Beware the lure of alcohol -- it can loosen restraints that are better left in place! People think that you're safe to tease and a soft target, but they'd better watch out -- if they accidentally press the wrong secret button, you're liable to erupt like Krakatoa. Be sure to give them adequate warning beforehand. You could sink comfortably into the slough of easy living, but make sure you have a plan "B" ready in case you find yourself struggling to emerge.`,
      libra: `The Pig/Libra possesses the unsavory habit of spending it as fast as it comes in the door, and not just in matters of money, either. Spoiled rotten, that's what you are -- waited on hand and foot by an army of admirers who will do anything to keep the Libra in you alive, happy and endlessly broadcasting. You will soon need to shake off the shackles of your habitual lethargy and get your hands dirty, but you are unsure of how to begin or whether indeed you are suitable for the task at all. Have no fear, dear Pig -- you're up to anything, if only you'd make it a habit to roll out of bed before noon. Don't get stranded at high tide during the decision-making process either, or else it will turn out to be a self-negating endeavor. Some things are better left to chance.`,
      scorpio: `The Pig/Scorpio is a throbbing python of love. Gifted with stratospheric sex appeal to coincide with your supremely rapacious Porcine libido, you change beds as easily as you change hats, and never fail to bring adequate protection. Emotionally speaking, however, you're a cold fish, as all of your inner desires are bound up in your relentless Scorpion's quest for power, fame and glory, or at least a big bank account. It's all right to be relentless in your drive for the top, but you needn't derive quite so much glee from your fiendish ability to hamstring your opponents on your way up the ladder. Your least lovable characteristic is your grasping nature -- the desire for absolute fealty from those who should love you solely from returned love, and not from a sense of claustrophobic obligation.`,
      sagittarius: `Don't spend it if you haven't got it. The tendency of the Pig/Sagittarius to live beyond their means will land you in hot water if not carefully controlled. You don't always have to be the good Sagittarian host -- let others in your social circle foot the bill once in a while. Cutting back on the unnecessary fripperies that you use to feather your sacrosanct Pig's nest may be one path to a balanced budget. Your uncanny luck has protected you thus far, but your good humor and flat stomach can't last forever without a little cooperation from your reservoirs of pure will power. Your sense of humor is a devastating weapon, and many are the times you've used it to make someone laugh himself or herself all the way to your swanky bedroom. Beware the impact of a sobering truth!`,
      capricorn: `The Pig/Capricorn should pay extra attention to their customarily elaborate daily schedule -- it's very important to know just when to knock off early and pamper yourself a bit doing that which soothes your work-frazzled Porcine nerves. If necessary, you can justify it as a gathering of the forces. You are ambitious but not self-destructively so, unlike some of your fellow members of the DoubleSign zodiac. A bit on the conservative side (as befits a true Capricorn heir), you often wish that you had been born in a previous century, back when "things made more sense." Don't waste too much time with these wishful reveries -- save them for when things look especially bleak, as a species of cold comfort. You're a stand-up sort, willing to take a few lumps in the line of duty, and your family and friends respect you for this sterling quality.`,
      aquarius: `It's better for you, as Pig/Aquarius, to try and concentrate, rather than flit about as you do from project to project. After all, without a dash of constancy, how will you ever achieve the income necessary to fulfill your fondest Porcine dreams of luxury? Watch out for excess avarice -- some people may start to cut you from their party lists if you let your acquisitive nature show a little too openly. You are the great Aquarian communicator, but what is necessary is damp down your round-the-clock transmissions from time to time. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this you cannot live without. Your friends are just that -- friends, and not sycophants, so don't try to stamp them all down into the same mold, because they just won't fit, and may break if handled carelessly. Remember that true friendship is only possible between equals!`,
      pisces: `Dinner party, anyone? The Pig/Pisces is the consummate arranger, and you will never lack for guests at one of your legendary soirees. You're not much for attending other people's parties, though -- you like to be in control, and have raised the entire process to a well-themed art form. Your dwelling place is both an abiding sense of strength for the Fishes within you and an anchor keeping you from experiencing new things. You are totally family-oriented (like all Pigs), and if you don't have a flock of little ones tugging at your leg yet, you soon will -- and you'll spoil the precious little angels rotten, if you have your way about it. Make absolutely certain that you've found the right partner for your serial acts of propagation, for the disruption of your life's nucleus can lead to terrifying bouts of despair which, while you might be equipped to handle them, won't exactly be a walk in the park for you.`,
